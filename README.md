# Weather-prediction-using-naive-bayes
Train a Naive Bayes model to predict weather conditions (drizzle, rain, sun, snow, fog) using precipitation, temp_max, temp_min, and wind features.
# About Dataset

Precipitation: Measures rainfall, snow, sleet, etc.

Maximum Temperature (temp_max): Highest daily temperature

Minimum Temperature (temp_min): Lowest daily temperature

Wind Speed (wind): Speed of the wind

Weather Condition (Target Variable):

  1)Drizzle
  
  2)Rain
  
  3)Sun
  
  4)Snow
  
  5)Fog
